# 🚗 AI Accident Detection Using YOLOv8  

An AI-powered accident detection system built using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once), capable of identifying road accidents from CCTV images and videos in real time.  
The model is trained on a custom dataset of accident and non-accident images to enable smart and efficient traffic monitoring.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **deep learning and computer vision** can be applied to improve road safety by detecting accidents automatically from visual footage.  
We utilized **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect accident regions within frames and raise automated alerts.

**Key Goals:**
- Detect accident scenes in real-time video feeds  
- Differentiate between accident and non-accident frames  
- Enable future integration with IoT alert systems

## 🧠 Concept Behind the Project

YOLOv8 (by Ultralytics) is a **one-stage object detector** that directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images in a single forward pass.  
This makes it ideal for real-time detection tasks such as **road accident detection** from CCTV footage.

**Working Principle:**
1. The input image/video is divided into grid cells.  
2. Each cell predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities.  
3. Non-Max Suppression (NMS) removes overlapping boxes.  
4. Final output shows bounding boxes labeled as *“Accident”* or *“No Accident”* with confidence scores.
